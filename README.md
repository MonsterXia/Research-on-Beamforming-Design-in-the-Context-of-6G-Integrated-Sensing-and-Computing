## 6G通感算一体化背景下波束成形设计研究

This is the codes for my Bachelor Thesis.

### Requirements:

| Python | PyTorch | CUDA |
| ------ | ------- | ---- |
| 3.9.16 | 2.0.0   | 11.7 |

### Dataset

As the dataset is to large for github repository, I moved it to Google Drive. Anyone who want to use this code need to download it via [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N65wbOUXIB6U_3d2oZ4hzWvk80BpHA-L?usp=drive_link) and create a folder named train_set in the root of the project and place the downloaded documents in it.

#### If it is helpful to you,I'd be grateful if you can **star** or **fork** this repo .
